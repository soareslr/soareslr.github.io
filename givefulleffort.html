					<p>Elijah Larios<br>Mrs. Burley-Hill<br>4-21-16<br>Narwhals<br>Elijah's ESLR Reflection<br><br>Introduction:	SOAR Charter Academy has its ESLR's to help shape us and our behavior for when we have to move on to high school and college. An ESLR is the Expected Schoolwide Learning Results. The ESLR's we have are Independently Thinker, Apply Good Character, Giving Full Effort, Life Long Learner, and Effective Communicator. Independent Thinker means that you do not need extra resources to help you with problems in life. Apply Good Character means applying the good character you have everywhere. Giving Full Effort is going all in, no exceptions. Life Long Learner means you want to always learn through your whole life. Effective Communicator means that you can communicate your thoughts effectively and get the person you are talking to to really listen.<br>Independent Thinker:	When you think independently, you are able to do things by yourself. You do not need a friend or a buddy to help you with things without them. To think independently, you have to be creative and be smart. We think independently when we decide for ourselves what we do in our lives, like picking from a menu or shopping for something, or even downloading files.
	We would want to think independently because we do not need someone in our life to always boss us what to do. We need to think independently so we can know how to do common things in life, like fix a printer, troubleshoot our really slow wifi, get help with a math problem. We need to think independently so we just do not give up and fix things by ourselves. We got to be big boys.
	I think independently sometimes, but sometimes peer pressure finds a way in. I thought independently the other day when I chose what to do and fix my computer. Some people do not think independently and just say whatever they think because other people make them. This can change someones point of view and how they think of things. It can change how they think of people and judge because other people are telling them to. 
Apply Good Character:
	What does it mean to have good character? Good character is when you can show how you act and express feelings in a good way. Having good character is also when you always show manners and you are polite when you talk to people. Like, for example, when someone has a bad day, you can cheer them up. One time I showed excellent character? I usually always show excellent character, by using manners and being polite, especially when i go out in public.
	Why do I think SOAR believes good character is so important? I think that SOAR believes in good character because they want us to grow up and excel, and we need good character to use our potential to excel in life. Why do I think having good character is important? For that same reason; we can just go way further in life, if we just try hard enough and have good character. It could help in family and friend relationships so you do not lose them later in life, also.
	How are you doing on character today? Do you think you've improved over your time at SOAR? As of today I do not have any bad character. I also think that my character is the exact same as it was before I came here to SOAR. Do I help others do the right thing here? Yes, if they need help with things, I can help them with doing the right thing and staying on the good path. Do I allow my friends to distract me from acting with good character? No, I do not.


Giving Full Effort:
	Giving full effort means giving all your work all in, no excuses. Working though hardships and frustrations is giving full effort. A time I gave full effort was on my science project last year. I tried my best to make the board and the whole project, but even though I did not get an A, (I got a B or a C) I still tried my hardest. Another time I did give full effort was for my 2016 community service project I did with Andrew O. It took a lot of work, but we managed to complete it in time, and I got an A for my community service project.
	It's important to give your best effort because you will then achieve more success in life. You will have to give full effort before you become successful though. You will face a lot of hard problems and eventually get stuck and stop at some brick wall, but in the end, all the hard work will pay off when you get what you originally wanted and, then all the hard work will be finished.
	I always try to give my full effort to school and family stuff. Sometimes I forget about homework assignments that teachers give me, but I still try to remember what I have to do for homework. I could give more effort with not getting mad at my family for some random reasons. I also need to give more effort to school, specifically Phys. Ed. I can give the full effort by dressing up for P.E. everyday and participate more in the activities that Mr. Armenta give to us

Life Long Learner
	​A life long learner is someone who likes to learn, someone who tries to learn, and thinks learning is rewarding. This means that what they learn, they get excited, and stick with what they learn. Learning is rewarding, is the mindset of life long learners, it means that knowing more is rewarding and may help you on future days. When you are a life long learner, you try to be your smartest, and get smarter every minute.
	​Being a life long learner can help meme because it can help you learn to put learning in your own hands; you can rely on recourses you already have, and not get stuck because you do not have anybody to help you. Being a life long learner can also help you set goals for the future. If you decide that you want to learn forever and give your full effort, then that is your goal, and that goal could help motivate you to achieve good grades for life.
	​I’m kind of a life long learner in school, I try to always get A’s in classes. I like to learn because then I can use that in my everyday life. I am also equipped with 21st century tools, I use Google and YouTube, etc. when I need help with things. You can get anything you need for an essay really with Google. I also am a life long learner for technology, I can get very fond with technology.
Effective Communicator:
	An effective communicator is someone who can communicate their thoughts thoroughly. An effective communicator can also communicate very good with technology and can have a wide vocabulary. They also can say their words clearly and get the person who is listening to them actually listen to the words they are saying. Someone who effectively communicates does not communicate by yelling, or using certain tones that imply an attitude.
	Being an effective communicator can help you in times when you want to be understood better. It is important in school and in life to be an effective communicator because it can help you spread your word faster, clearer, and better, and it can help more people pay more attention to what you have to say. It can also help help your vocabulary and your relationships with people because of your communication skills.
	I think I can be an effective communicator at sometimes, but sometimes I am not. Sometimes in math class I communicate my answers effectively. Usually in other classes I try to raise my hand and participate, and effectively communicate my answers. One example of when I effectively communicated was in Communication Class when I had to do a lot of very long speeches; I did all the speeches and I got an A grade.
Conclusion:
	The ESLR I am best at is Give Full Effort because I always try to give all my effort. The ESLR I should work on the most is probably Effective Communicator because I am not really that good at making speeches and expressing my speech that well. I think most people at SOAR should follow our ESLR's because they will help us with high school and college.
